# TicTacToe

TicTacToe is an iOS application created in Swift that allows a user to play the game Tic Tac Toe with another user. One user chooses a X while the other user chooses an O. The users take turns marking their X or O on a three by three grid. The user who places three of his/her X or O in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row first wins the game.
